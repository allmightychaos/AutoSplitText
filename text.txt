okay in this video i'm going to be talking about pretty much every book that's helped me i'm going to start with one of the first books that i've read
the four-hour work week i'm going to breeze through the ones that i've mentioned loads of time so this book taught me that
you should not be working in a environment in which your input equals output if you are judged on your input
input equals like input is like the work that you're doing right so if you're working in customer service the work
that you do for an hour gets you the output of eight pounds so if we times
the input by 40 40 hours a week then you'll get the output which is eight times 40 which is
[ __ ] 320 so 320 pounds a week and this is the
book that really i read this before i had even worked like a full-time job or anything i read
this just before i got my first full-time job and it this book along with another one called the millionaire
fast lane by mj demarco they're the first two books that i read and they were books on entrepreneurship and
making money because i just graduated from university i'm trying to figure out like what the [ __ ] to do in my life and
they were a fantastic honestly like a 10 out of 10 introduction into starting a business and
sort of branching away from the nine to five rat race the four-hour workweek tells you how to
heavily reduce your work hours so that you have more freedom the book alongside this is i don't have like a physical
copy but it's the millionaire fastlane by mj demarco and that one especially if you're like somewhat of a young person
and you're a bit clueless in terms of businesses so you've heard you know everyone say like okay make a business be like what the like what the [ __ ] does
that really even mean like what how do you know like which business to do like how do businesses actually work what's a good business what like you know like
if you're completely clueless the millionaire fastlane by mj demarco so mj demarco is an author who's just
like the go-to guy for things of like escaping the rat race with making a business in the millionaire fast lane he
breaks down the principles of a good good quality business that can last and can make a lot of money and i'm not
gonna remember all of them right now but it's like an energy called sense c-e-n-t-s and so it's like control entry
i don't know end but like you get what i mean so it's just like principles that you can follow and so if you're into business right now i highly recommend
the four-hour work week in the millionaire fastlane i've mentioned those two books so many time on my channel so you can tell like i really
vouched for those books the third book that i ever read was the subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] by mark
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F
manson i remember reading this book um when i was down bad depression and
everything this was just before i moved back home to warrington so i was living with my girlfriend at the time and i was
smoking weed all day you know just living like a [ __ ] like weirdo and i literally remembered this book
every single time i would sit down to read this book it felt like i got like quite a life-changing insight it was a
very it was like a big struggle to read that's at that time i'm not gonna lie when you've got mental health problems when you're high all the time when
you're eating [ __ ] food and your brains just like [ __ ] it was it was always a struggle trying
to sit down and read this book but every single time i did i remember i would literally be in awe of like the
knowledge and the insights i would get from here i've wanted to reread the book many times but when i do try and reread it it
kind of has like a very like it's obvious now so if you're like down bad this book might help you but if you're
kind of quite a healthy productive person you might not really need this book because you already have like these mental models inside of your mind
but this one specifically there was one huge insight that really changed my life which was that mark manson the author of
this book said that no matter what you choose you're going to have to experience problems you're just going to have to be like a lifelong problem
solver it's time now to not pick the rewards that we want of a
certain endeavor because that leaves you clueless if you only think of the rewards that you want the benefits that
you want from these two sports or these two jobs it's incredibly hard to choose
because okay you could be a youtuber or you could be a rapper and like oh you could you could get really famous and really rich from both of them and you
could get really you know i mean the better thing to make decisions is to think about what kind of problem that
you want to choose and this really like changed it all for me because at this point i was trying a bunch of different
businesses obviously i read the four i worked with the millionaire fast lane and so i was trying to think okay maybe i could like code my own apps maybe i
could write ebooks i could be like an author or something and i could be a drop shipper and i tried to be a [ __ ] rapper as
well and uh i was making a couple of youtube videos and at this point of the book i
literally just sat down and said okay which problems do i want to solve and for me straight away it was it was the youtube it was like the problems
that arise with youtube which namely at the time was just problems in terms of like the software that you'd use to like
edit videos because sometimes it crashed because i didn't pay for that [ __ ] i like pirated it so every now and then it would crash
and it really let's just hit me like yeah that's a problem that i can overcome if there's a crash or if there's like an
error in this software i can just go and search up some like akash from tech india who's going to tell me about
problem 337 or something and like that's an easy problem to fix at the time i didn't spend too much time thinking
about this it probably would have been worthwhile but i also did acknowledge that oh yeah like maybe i'll get like hate comments and like i don't really
mind about that because maybe it's like an opportunity to grow but at least this book really did help me at the time
How to Win Friends and Influence People
so i moved back home may 2020 and i think one pretty much the first book that i read when i moved back towards it
was how to win friends and influence people this is like the bible of social skills and
you might not think that you need this book because you've already got a couple of friends and everything just trust me when i say
just read it just read this [ __ ] book like i had this book two years before that
point when i actually read it like i literally had this book in university i bought it because so many people online were talking about it i read the first
few pages okay this is basic he's given like old examples and like i don't need to be told not to criticize or condemn
people i don't need to be told to like complain or to smile when you just invest heavily into this
book and you just think okay dale carnegie is like one of the first people who ever spoke about self-improvements
people call him like the godfather of self-improvement for a reason
if you just place your trust in this and even though it seems like obvious it's okay smile use the person's name firm
handshake you know it's like basic [ __ ] but when you invest in a book it just gets ingrained in your mind and at least for me i always thought that i had
pretty good social skills i live like the party life inside of university like i was the center of like the certain
social circle that i was in because i was hosting the parties i was the one who's like leading the knights and you know choosing where to go and everything
and so i've i had this huge arrogance that i didn't need to know these [ __ ] social skill tips
and when i tell you that this reading this book and implementing these tips like truly changed my life
you should probably be thinking like yeah like maybe if hamza's you know he was living the party lifestyle everything maybe his social skills
probably would have been better than mine because i've just spent two years inside overcovered
it's a very good basic refresher and there's a few principles one of the things i really liked about this book that i've still got like these little
things is that there's just like a page that literally just tells you the principles which is like in a nutshell
so it's in a nutshell six ways to make people like you principle number one become genuinely interested in other
people now that seems like when you when you've heard me say like it seems just like common sense like okay become interested in other people but when
you're reading the principle and you're really like you sit there and think okay am i using this in my life at least for
me i was like you know what like i'm not like i don't feel like i've been really
really interested in other people recently i feel like i've made it all about me because i love the center of attention but everyone feels like that
when you're the one random guy out of a random group like a big group who's literally thinking oh yeah let me like
you know be interested in other people let me ask them loads of questions and see like what they've got to teach me or something you're going to stand out people are
going to love talking to you still to this day i find myself like needing to like rethink of these principles
very very good book but i think it's often overlooked by a bunch of people who have like this huge [ __ ] ego that
they think they don't need to like learn this stuff so at about this point now may slash
Influence
june 2020 this is when i've started reading books and so i've actually got i use it as a computer and monitor stand
but i've got a book that i read here so i started youtube and i probably read this one a couple of months later but it's just the one that i've got here
right now it's just influencer by dust everywhere bro influencer by joseph
granny kerry patterson so when i started youtube i
i got into reading i wanted to start reading and based on because i was giving people advice and i thought okay
imagine if i actually learn how to like make people take my advice like that would be some next level shift i could
be the guy who i tell you okay meditate and exercise but i say it in a certain way that actually gets you to meditate
and exercise that's like that's a million dollar business right there if i can be the one to influence you to get onto the good habits so i look
specifically for books on influence and there was a couple of big ones there's a book i believe it's on influence yeah
it's influence by robert card you know something like that it's a really big famous book i didn't really
like that one this is like a very quite underground book it's made for like um teachers or anything but like it's a
very very easy read with like nice stories and the principles are that to influence people
there's like a bunch of different categories that you can focus on but the main thing that you can do at least as a
content creator in my opinion like my example is on personal motivation if i can
motivate you to go and do an action then you'll do it there's other things like they went into detail so for example
there's like structural influence there's societal infl obviously they're like you know things that we're probably
not considering right now but the page is falling out and everything but you'll you can kind of tell that
i've been taking the advice from this so for to motivate someone one of the
best tactics is to tell meaningful stories that's why like this literally reading this book completely changed the
formula of my videos because before i would start the video like reading from a [ __ ] script and be like the best way to cure back pain is you know i'd be
just saying some [ __ ] when i read this book i realized that yeah like every single time that i've been like
moved by a video it's because they had like a storyline like we are so so motivated by stories i tell a story in
every single one of my videos now i don't just tell you like oh yeah you should meditate i say oh yeah before i
started meditating this is what life was like but then i found meditation but then it didn't work but then i really tried to make it work and it worked and
this is what life is like now you tell a story you change someone's life
i really like this book it's not it's not one that i reread because it's quite basic and it's just kind of like yeah just you know motivate them and give
them experiences tell them stories but it's quite like a nice introduction into influencing a behavior changing to
someone if you're doing work similar to me so if you're a youtuber content creator if you're a teacher if you're in
anything where you have to influence people and of course like influence you use it literally 24 7 anyway but i'd say
if you're gonna influence like people to be better if you're gonna influence like an audience i'd highly recommend this book it's influencer by joseph greeney
kerry patterson and like a couple of other people i read this book afterwards as well so
Oxygen Advantage
that influencer booker and this book is what i use for my monitor
just dust everywhere clean my room okay
so this is the oxygen advantage by patrick mcewen so this is kind of like an interesting book kind of like
different to what you'd expect because so far it's just been like a self-improvement type of books this is based on
the real way that we're supposed to be breathing which is very different from how most of us breathe right now
breathing is so overlooked and this book i've read a recent book as
well i've read like another book on breathing recently which we'll discuss but if you are someone who's like a mouth
breather if you're someone who doesn't really sleep well books like this will change your life
like there's a real like healthy way to breathe and probably at least 50 of people who are
watching this aren't breathing like that a lot of us breathe from our mouths because we just
like you can see like i'm taking a breath it wanted to have it two your nose kind of gets blocked sometimes so
you kind of need to three the modern food that we have just kind of [ __ ] up like the whole system and everything of course like i don't
remember most of the science but the general idea is like modern life is just terrible for breathing and anything
that's terrible for breathing truly [ __ ] up your health a lot more than you think you'd think okay it's not that
important it's only to do with like cardiovascular skill like lung capacity something that goes way further than
that in the new book that i read on this just a month ago called breath the new
science of a lost art i don't know who it's by there's so much research to show that
mouth breathing completely [ __ ] up your health it's actually one of those like weird things
that like truly ruins your life but it's so overlooked so the gist is stop mouth breathing and you might start
complaining and say wait but like i can't believe someone also have to breathe from my mouth we're supposed to breathe a lot less
like the issue right now of course you know air pollution everything the quality of the air around us is very
very bad but the one of the biggest the things that we can control as an individual person
is the quantity of the air that we breathe and we breathe too much so we inhale way too fast because we're all
mindless you're like if you become aware of this right now you might be in disbelief but if you become aware of this you'll actually be shocked
if you're you know you become you know you're like daydreaming you're going through your day whatever you're not focused on this and then you get that
thought of oh yeah let me like you know um breathe properly you'll realize that for the last while
you've been breathing like you've got anxiety like we breathe like this like even if you're not a mouthpiece like
you're watching this video and you think of the exemption even though i'm saying this right now
you still think of the example exemption and you think that i'm not talking to you i'm telling you right now the overwhelming majority of people that
i've been around breathe wrong the overwhelming majority of people that i've been around breathe wrong i've
spent some like good time around people like with girls that i've like been on dates with and like nights out with and like stayed over like in hotels and so
if you're sleeping next to someone you really like you can really become aware of what their breathing patterns right i'm
telling you right now since i've been reading this book and another book on breathing i'm like really clued up on like who's breathing properly and i'm
telling you it's not that many people it's really like i'm not even the perfect example of this because
obviously like my very like i'm still trying to train this [ __ ] as well but the majority of people that i come
across breathe like this the right way to breathe is with a very
soft inhale as much as your nose will allow you so if your nose is stuffy and you think wait no i can't do this hamster you're like this is [ __ ]
because my nose is stuffy so i have to breathe from my mouth how much you can breathe from your nose is how much you're supposed to breathing
from your nose is kind of like a skill and so if you haven't been leveling up this skill for a while you're going to be like a low level in this skill to
begin with and you're going to be [ __ ] at it first you have to keep going through the trials and tribulations it's like it's kind of like you deserve to
suffer you deserve to have that awkward like you know that [ __ ] of like you can't breathe properly and everything and that
feeling of like air hunger which patrick mcewen really really like really nails into you and he says the feeling of air
hunger is what we need so we should be breathing so slow and so peacefully that we actually do get a sense of the air
hunger that we get like a sense of breathlessness so he said the perfect breath which actually lines up with the
perfect breath from the other book that i mentioned breath the new science of the lost art is about a five to six second soft very
soft slow inhale and a very very extended five to six second exhale
breathing from the diaphragm that's really really important a lot of people are chest breathers as well and for me
patrick mcewen really really made it simple exercise to just start breathing from your diaphragm but just put your hand there put your hand on your stomach
and just start guiding it out guide your stomach out as you breathe
as you breathe in push it out
exhale it comes in breathe in push out exhale comes in
Breathe In
really good book this book's like [ __ ] thick and he goes into a person obviously it's just one of those books
where he just kind of like tells you about the thing but then he should he goes on to give you so much evidence and
like data and everything of like how breathing is literally like the number one thing that we we're all missing and
it's literally it'll improve your diet it'll improve your your body composition your physical injury and so many random
things it's one of those things where like you know you read the book on like a certain topic like walking and then you think like oh [ __ ] like the amount
of research this [ __ ] put in it's like this is the most important thing ever that's what this book is like so
it was kind of like a hard read it was sometimes when i would be reading it and i had to like reread the paragraph
because he uses quite like advanced terminology and everything it's a very good book and i recommend it
mostly honestly if you're not too bothered about this then fair enough but i recommend it specifically for the people who have trouble breathing who
mouth breathe and know that their mouth breathe and they want to stop mouth breathing and also if you have trouble sleeping because i would say
probably the most common reason for trouble sleeping not like not getting to sleep but i mean like staying asleep and
you probably wake up feeling quite sick and you're like a dry throat and everything is how you breathe and he really goes into it in detail
so i got those books and then this might not be all you know i've had
this book for a while the 48 laws of power i'm not gonna lie i wouldn't say that this is like
that it's hard to say because for example like this was a random page right but
this law number seven get others to do the work for you but always take the credits now technically that's a law of
power right get others to do the work for you but always take the credit but this is totally outdated this this would
have worked 100 this would have worked 50 years ago 100 years ago you're the guy in the factory or anything and you know the factories pumped out the number
one production then you're going to come in there come there and take the recognition 400 but the new age of
business this type of [ __ ] doesn't work this type of [ __ ] actually gets you hated on if imagine if like i completely
acted in a way that showed you that like my editors were worthless and that it's only me i'm a one-man army
i wouldn't actually get more power from that if anything i'd have power stripped away from me because people would like me less because right now we're becoming
a lot more like social and like nice to each other we're collaborating a lot more and so a lot of like a bunch of
these laws are quite dry and quite outdated like they don't seem to work but a couple of them do
absolutely work and there was a couple that
i wonder if you could find them like okay so like a standard one is always a less than necessary i thought about this law just a few days
ago that's the standard that's like a timely one always say less than necessary now
of course it's kind of odd because i could have made this video like 10 minutes long it's probably gonna be more
like an hour so saying more than necessary is kind of helpful here so obviously you've got to use your intuition to think you know when this is
useful but in terms of relationships in terms of especially with dating for example law number four always say less
than necessary has done me very very well
went through your actions and everything wrong this is really good i'm not gonna lie it's one of those books that like you're not supposed to read cover to
cover that's what like i should actually explain this this is kind of a tangent maybe like someone can timestamp this or
something oh yeah i was gonna say like someone please timestamp this [ __ ] cause i'm not gonna like re-watch this video but if anyone's going through the vid
then just kind of like leave timestamps um there's a right way to read books and i
don't think many people are actually reading books in the right way you're not supposed like books aren't sacred it's like it's nothing you're not
supposed to read a book like you're dumb broke teachers told you to read the education system ruined [ __ ] learning
like the education system has ruined education reading is how you get education but they've those [ __ ] have convinced you that
you you get this book as an assignment you read it front to back and you have to answer questions and take notes that's [ __ ] [ __ ] if you're
highlighting when you're reading you're just stupid that [ __ ] doesn't do anything [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up
i like shut the [ __ ] up highlighting when you're reading stupid reading a book from start to finish is stupid you're not supposed to read like that if
it's a book that you've already read before you really like it if it's like book that really really captures your interest fair enough but if you force
yourself to read a book from start to finish if you're a [ __ ] dick and you ask me how many books i read a year or
if you made one of those [ __ ] dumbass youtubers who like oh but reading 20 reading 52 books last year here's what i
shut the [ __ ] up what is wrong with you what is wrong with this [ __ ] like this culture of people like people thinking that it's
like like a medal that i read 52 i read a book a week so
how much did you learn dumb that's not much because you're [ __ ] you're literally just skimming the [ __ ] page like you're not even learning you're
just reading for the sake of the [ __ ] ego boost if you want to learn from this [ __ ] you don't read it like you did in
school you don't read it like most people do you get an interest for example in here
you're interested right now in reducing your workload so you go to the part where he talks about that you're
curious of it and you learn that boom now you're done with it law on this if you like get this oh i'm
gonna read the fourier laws of power law number one you're a dumbass what you do is you go to the preface when there's
he's listed every single one and you see which one captivates your attention right now
recreate yourself that's the one for me lord 25 so i would go straight to law 25 and i would read that one and i would
contemplate i would sit here and think oh yeah like you know he said to recreate yourself and he gave me the story how can i use that right now if
you're sat here law one law two loath all the way to law 48 trust me when i say you're not learning anything trust
me when i say you're doing it for [ __ ] ego you like reading is such a beautiful thing but the overwhelming majority of
people just read in the totally wrong way and then they don't get any benefit from it
and that's the side tangent honestly it's so incredibly important because you need to be taught how to actually
[ __ ] read and school just ruin this [ __ ] for us but yeah uh side note the 48 laws of power is a good
ass book so then i believe at this point is when i got my
kindle so we can go on this now i wonder if i if i plug my charger
The Power of Now
this camera is kind of trash bro this [ __ ] it's gonna die now
if i plug this in like i it's not even gonna do anything okay okay let's go so
i've gone all the way back on my kindle and i read i read the power of now
see that bottom one the power of now by eckhart tolle to be honest i didn't really vibe with it that much but i feel
like i was quite new to meditation at the time so i was gonna plan i was planning to reread it uh soon so i might
like it more but it was very very promoted but i didn't really like getting that much insight
from it although i did sort of it did just highlight the importance of presence and mindfulness which i guess
like you know probably helped me snowball my mindfulness training to take it more seriously the earliest book i
have on here which i feel like helps me is the e-myth revisited very very interesting book the e-mis e-myth
revisited by michael e gerbra and it's this idea that
making a business is not the same as doing the tasks so he gives the story which i'm sure we've all heard of
let's say there's a builder like a bricklayer or you know like a competitor one of those random trades right and
he's employed by someone he's doing it he's like oh you know what like i should be self-employed i should have my own business so he makes his own
business and it's actually a negative compared to his life previously because
now his boss he's got the worst boss in the world which is himself and all he has is just extra
responsibility and extra tasks what he's done is the wrong thing which a lot of brown people do which is that they make
a business just to give themselves a job that is not the point of a business that is not what you do when you're trying to
like start like a company or something that's stupid as [ __ ] you don't make a business to give yourself a job you make a business to give other people jobs so
that they do the work for you and you sick back and you like kind of like you're the one who takes the risk and
that has all the leverage of course you know like so for example
with this business i'm doing right now no one can do this work which is like being on the camera because you're here for hamza right but i've outsourced most
of the tasks to the point that now all that's left is actually the fun task that i wanted to do in the first place
so the e-myth revisited it goes through almost in like a story fashion of the
right way to create a business and like you know the right mindsets are having the right need for the business and he
says that most people just don't do it in the right way because they just give themselves a job so another example is
for example the brown guy who creates a business where it's like owning a shop like a corner store
he's just got a shitty job now he's got like a very very like poor level job that he's not proud of
someone's gonna oh wait he's working shut the [ __ ] up okay like he's not proud of it he's dealing with [ __ ] my dad owned the shop we like
[ __ ] did child slave labor there bro i'm telling you right now it's not like a good place to be but he's working hard
shut the [ __ ] up okay you just when you make a business like that you've just given yourself a job
and usually that job is actually quite like a low-level job it's the same as for example just like
it's it's a bunch of [ __ ] low-level business like businesses right they're not businesses you've just employed yourself and of course you know that
it's a job that you've got right now and you're making money for enough you will be grateful but the idea is that you can create such a beautiful business when
you do it in the right way i'm trying to recount some of the learning lessons here but the general gist for me was to make sure that
you're like employing people in a very standardized fat like a franchise fashion that's actually so i read this
book and that's when i got my first video editor sam and he still like tells the story every now and then where i was
his first client so he went on the website fiverr to you know sell his services as a video editor i was his
first client and i literally wrote up like a document of instructions that i wanted him to follow like a step by step
do this this is this checklist and everything like 25 points like do exactly this and render it with this
setting this this upload it here do this exactly like this because my idea was which i got from this is to have like a
system in which other people like you can franchise your business so i thought okay the bit that i can i can't
franchise like myself or anything but the bit i can franchise is the video editor i didn't realize at the time that
sam was like the first video like the proper first video that i got and who would actually stay around
if you know actually you know what i had a bunch of brown people before sam actually so on fiverr i was looking for
people to be my video editor and i had the idea which i got from the four hour work week by tim ferriss which was to
outsource to a country like pakistan in a sense that one it's like lower wages but two it almost gave me like a sense
of fulfillment because you know i'm like i'm giving them a job and everything and they're getting like a fair amount of money per hour
the work from them up quite frankly was just sub-par completely completely sub-par and there wasn't like a good
working relationship but as i was going through those original editors that i got from fiverr doing random
videos i was updating this system like this this documents so by giving everyone the same document of
instructions it was a very standardized like systemized franchise process and you can see you're taking a business
like very very seriously when you do [ __ ] like this so the idea is that for you
if you're if you're branching into like a business number one make sure it's the right type of business make sure it's a business
where you employ people and you haven't just employed yourself into standardize and systemize employing
people to do the tasks that you want mcdonald's does this perfectly it's all like a clear-cut franchise
my camera's gonna die uh brb okay apologies for that my camera just died i swear this tripod's a bit unequal
yeah that was the e-myth revisited the next one we have uh yeah so this is
The Psychology of Selling
now about the time when i actually started like selling things from youtube and i read the book the psychology of
selling by brian tracy that one in the top middle the psychology of selling by brian's tracy this was a fantastic book
this was like essentially a fundam a fundamental basic introduction
to sales and you've probably heard before like you know sales is such an important skill like the the way that you learn
sales is kind of like everything else but it seems like quite like a weird interesting topic that you really want
to learn but you're just kind of like unsure how to do it you read a book like this the psychology of selling by brian tracy and you just get told like random
things that stay in your mind and some of the fundamental stuff is like
you're literally just serving the customer you're just trying to help them so you know that [ __ ] you're like oh like sell me this pen and you're
supposed to think of something like you know fancy or something really the best example of you know sell me this pen
oh like you know i'm trying to sell you this pen is like i'll ask you like do you want to buy a pen are you in the market to buy a pen if the guy says like
no i don't want to buy okay then then you leave it sales it's not about some [ __ ] like manipulation tactics where
you're like oh let me convince you to buy this pen and you know this pen was signed by thingy and you know some like weird clickbaity type of [ __ ] it's
literally just about serving the customers needs so the best salesman just ask a lot of questions it is you've got to not see
sales as something where it's like me versus you and that's how i used to actually think of it honestly this book
and another one that we'll talk about really changed a lot for me if i didn't read this book i wouldn't be where i am
right now because it was the sales aspect it was like the business aspect of youtube that actually got me here
that actually got me interested because i am an entrepreneur at heart and so the idea with sales and the basic
fundamental stuff that i remember from this is essentially let's say you want to sell something to someone like you've got a product that you're selling you
ask questions and you figure out what their hot spot is you figure out what they're really really interested in so if i try to sell you right now like this
this hair product there's like you know whack stuff style your hair and you want to buy one right so i'm asking you
instead of just saying oh you want to buy this so you know this has this has this and this and this this it's kind of like the same as the social
skills that we learn from how to win friends and influence people be interested in them in the customer not in yourself so i could tell you oh yeah
you know this this hair product has like uh 53 beeswax or some [ __ ] it's like you're going to be bored
but i would be asking you just questions like oh yeah what you want to use this for and you'll say oh yeah like like i
want to style my hair so it looks nice and attractive for my instagram pitch [ __ ] you i [ __ ] hate that noise oh my god let
me turn that [ __ ] off we got a podcast coming live with chris williamson right now
yeah i might stop this video so i can share that with but so you'll tell me like oh yeah like you want to look better on your instagram
pictures and that's like the thing that you get really excited for then i'll ask you another question like oh yeah like you know this is uh
water like rain resilience and they're like oh yeah like whatever a bad salesman would keep bringing up every
feature point that he has like oh yeah it's you know this is water resilient but you didn't give a [ __ ] what you really cared about was that you wanted
better hair for instagram pictures so that's the point i would keep nailing down and i'd like ask you like you know i'd hype you up for i'd be like how much
does that work for you how many like followers do you have and everything do you think this is gonna help you quite a lot you're gonna style it in a certain
way well talk about the thing that you're really really interested in then you close the sale then you say yeah like why don't money just take it so
obviously i wasn't selling physical products when i read this book i was selling my coaching at the time my coaching was like pretty
affordable but it was starting to get to the point where it was like actually becoming like you know a decent price so when i first started my coaching and my
one-to-one coaching myself in broome coaching i was charging less than minimum wage i was charging about a
couple pounds an hour literally about half of what minimum wage is in the uk because i was like
doing it for fun i was charging less than about half then of minimum wage and i was doing more than one hour for that
rate so it was the equivalent of literally like a pound or one one or two pounds per hour that's what i was like
doing because i was just like sitting on the court for like two hours with the guys and everything i just became more and more business
orientated and i realized that's not like there's no [ __ ] future in like doing a [ __ ] two and a half hour call
for like five pounds and i started actually like not feeling bad i think honestly a big part of sales is knowing
that like it is a moral thing to do it is like there is an absolute need for a salesman
you have a need the salesman fulfills it by giving you the product like you know just showing you the product and telling
you its features and everything that you needed and sales to be a salesman to like sell
feels kind of dirty because of this idea of you know like the sleazy car salesman and everything
but books like this really opened up my mind and thought like yeah like actually like it is a very positive thing to do
and i remember there was for months i was on this on and off type of
mindset in terms of sales you know trying to sell products to my customers it was actually a random youtuber called
casey zander so a fair amount of you guys might know him he's like in the red pill masculine
space and i watched a random video of his where he talked about his products he talked about learning sales and he just said
like yeah like he likes sales he loves being able to like provide the value to his customers to like provide to sell
them something that's going to help them and that really it just made me click and i was like oh yeah like you can view it as a positive thing
to sell someone a product that you've made that you know is going to help them like that's you should feel very proud of that process
so the idea is that you make a product that you or you know you have a product that you're proud of or a service that you're proud of you think it's going to
help this person you ask them questions you're not just you know like movies have really [ __ ] us over it
like if you're trying to learn sales movies have really shown you this dirty idea of like oh yeah pursue the sale and you'll get the sale no matter what and
be hard ass and stuff really being a good salesman in the modern day especially when you can get like critiqued for it especially if you
know you're attaching sales to like your personal brand like i am if i sell too hard or in the wrong way my brand's
gonna get ruined and people will actually start to like dislike me for it wouldn't they the reason why like you probably
i'd say the overwhelming majority of people who watch my videos probably wouldn't consider me a salesman i use sales techniques and everything and i
use marketing techniques but i do it in such like a humble very very infrequent way that it doesn't
seem to piss that many people of course some like some nobody's coming in and like oh i'm okay only cares about when the [ __ ] how the [ __ ] you get that idea
from me that i only care about money at least you got videos of me just saying like yeah like it doesn't matter i just meditate instead and [ __ ] and of course
like i need money for the business but it's like one of the comments that really this is kind of off point but
i comment on it was on discord i don't think the guys even knew that i was like reading it but i just really appreciate it it was like some random guys who was
just saying like hamza doesn't sell us his products nearly as much as he could do like he doesn't push us to like and i
was like i took i was taken aback because when you do try and sell things online as your personal brand people
just dislike you for it people love to buy but they hate to be sold to and this really honestly like really hurt me for
a while because i never wanted to be seen as like a salesman and like anytime someone would tell like say like oh you
know you're just trying to sell or something or hamza is just trying to make money it would really hurt because it's like it was one of those where it was like if
it was completely false it would probably not affect me but the fact that like there is truth in it like yes i
like i do want to make money and for a long time like a bunch of people like a bunch of like viewers and everything
made me feel like honestly very bad for like wanting to make money from from youtube from this business
and it's just certain key moments like reading this book and watching that random cases and the video and these random guys on discord and like a few
conversations with some that's really just made me feel more positive and i'm like yeah like but it but it is a business like i am a businessman i'm an
entrepreneur i was an entrepreneur first and then a youtuber second and i wanted to make not only just you know like a
humble income i wanted to make a good amount of money like come on let's let's be [ __ ] real with it right now like
apologies hang on my screens just turn the nightlight thing on you know there's this like hype i was in this lifestyle
Why Not
as well but like it's so easy in the modern days to say like oh you know i don't care about money i just want to be happy but it's like why not why not both
why not both we need we need the level of confidence to actually just admit like yeah like i
want to sell my product i want to make a product that sells a lot a lot of like people in the modern day
think that that's vain or you know they'll dislike you for it's the same level of you saying like oh yeah i want to get muscular and like you know some
random like dick is just going to say oh you want to get muscular that's because you were a small dick or that's because your your ego is some [ __ ] but it's
like yeah why not well people are making money why not me
so books like this honestly like it it truly changed the trajectory of
Money
my my sort of status on youtube where i realized yeah there's like there's good money to be made and i'm telling you
right now this is like this is the one boast i'm gonna allow myself for this video right
i'm a better entrepreneur who makes more money than a lot of youtubers big youtubers i make
more money from my audience of like you know two hundred and something 230k that
youtubers who have like a million or two million do and of course you know a lot of people will be able to sell oh no but i don't care about money
the thing is you would happily take more money so don't be a little bit you would happily like take more money if you could do right
a big part of sales and a big part of making money is just honestly setting the intention to and this book and there was another book
as well that we'll go on to really dialed in this point of like your self-belief because however your parents manage
their money and however they kind of interacted with you with money you know your parents gave you pocket money or they spoke about money that you've got
core beliefs inside of your mind that you aren't really that conscious of and one of the interesting stories was
we have like a like a pretty much an income limit that we feel comfortable with and will really surpass that and
this this [ __ ] blew my mind this story he told them i'd assume it's a real story but he's pretty much saying like some random salesman that he knew
saw himself as like a 5 000 a year man so five thousand dollars a year would have been like a big this book's like
100 years old or 50 years old or something so 5 000 a year would have been like a very good wage at the time
but like not high height level but like a good level right and the idea was he'd make like his his
amount this salesman would make five thousand dollars and then he'd get sick afterwards he'd make five thousand
dollars and then he'd just like you know lose the mojo lose the motivation to continue doing sales or he wouldn't be at five thousand dollars he'd be quite
significantly underneath but the years about to end and suddenly he gets to five thousand it's kind of similar if you know of
parkinson's law it's kind of similar to that where it's like you'll you'll do the thing
it's hard to explain but you can hopefully see like my [ __ ] brain cells are trying to like be be switched on here but
you will hit the income that you feel like you can hit that's a good way of putting it right
with sales with just making money you will make as much money as you feel like you can make
now you can't [ __ ] yourself you can't just say oh i feel like i can make a million because you don't [ __ ] believe it a lot of like young guys
could do it i i see guys in both ends of this the spectrum and they're both artists i see the guy who lives in india
but i gotta make that much money shut the [ __ ] up bro you know but i'm saying like hamza doesn't understand because i work a full
time shut the [ __ ] up why why are you rejecting yourself why are you just giving yourself limiting
beliefs all right hamsa wouldn't understand like i'm arguing for you you're arguing against you have some
[ __ ] respect for yourself man so there's these like small dick [ __ ] who are like oh but i couldn't make that much money but then
there's also like a bunch of these like pseudo big dick teenagers who are like
oh we're like oh yeah i'm gonna be a millionaire like i spoke to a lot of these guys in my early coaching days i spoke to a lot of guys who had this
[ __ ] like yeah i'm going to make 5 million next year hamsa thinking that i'd be proud of them i'm going to be like the biggest rapper ever shut the
[ __ ] up bro just [ __ ] up like i i'm all for being ambitious but you can't fake
this [ __ ] and trust me when i say like if right now you're a broke dumbass little little [ __ ] dumb kid
you're not even like being productive let's say this this guy wants to be a [ __ ] dropshipper but he's like barely working on it he's like then you don't
deserve to say i'm gonna make a million no you're not i'm gonna be the best rapper but you're barely making rap so shut the [ __ ] up
like yeah you should be the goals that you set and you know the limit that you set yourself of this like sort of subconscious like
limit this bar that you feel like you're worthy of you should start to manually set this to
a point that is reasonably unreasonable reasonably unreasonable so if right now
you're a broke down my students your goal should be to make five to ten thousand dollars in a couple of years
per month five let's say ten thousand dollars within two years from now so every month you're making ten thousand dollars two years from now that's
reasonably unreasonable that's a that's a lot of money that's a good amount of money and two years it's like that's yeah that's reasonably unreal it's
unreasonable but it's quite reasonable at the same time saying that oh but in two years i'm
going to be no no you're not going to be a [ __ ] millionaire bro shut the [ __ ] up but at the same time there's people who
are just way too reasonable and then they don't ever end up actually achieving that goal so for this salesman
it was the the five thousand one it's like okay even if you hit the reasonable goal
it's not that amazing but for most people when they do set a reasonable goal in sales and a lot of young guys
say like oh bahamas just you know stop all this biz like business stuff just teach us how to make 100 a month online
you won't do it because it's not worth it to make a hundred dollars a month you have to work harder than if to make five
to ten thousand literally because to make 100 a month the only really like the way that these dumb little kids want
me to answer is to hop on to [ __ ] fiverr and like do [ __ ] child slave labor to make two pounds an hour for 50
hours this month right now and you'll get the ego boost oh yeah i made 100 but you just you made two pounds an hour
if it's too reasonable if the bar like that you've set yourself of income is too low you'll either won't do it or you
will and like your achievements just trash anyway there's a book that's coming up i'm surprised it's not already come up maybe
like kindle kind of like re-organizes them but there's a book that's coming up the magic of thinking big and the author of
that book talks about the fact that big goals and small goals take about as much effort anyway and i know that seems
really crazy but it's honestly true because a small goal has this extra mental load where you're like you're not
you're quite resentful to do the work because you're like i'm not even gonna get that big of a benefit anyway
this is those [ __ ] i've criticized this before this is the guys who come into the gym and they say oh i don't want to get too big i just want to
get toned okay well you're not going to make any progress then you're going to quit because when it starts getting difficult when your muscles are [ __ ]
sore and you don't feel like going to the gym and it's raining outside you're not going to show up because i just want to get toned this [ __ ]
reasonably unreasonable was saying that yeah like i want to build like the 10 out of 10 physique for me of the aesthetic b taper so 175 pounds or 6.1
like that's reasonably unreasonable but my mindset was like yeah in 10 years
i'm pretty much there i'm like 90 of the way to that to that goal it was reasonably unreasonable
this book so the psychology of selling really started opening up my mind to
Sales
like this kind of like this this lifestyle in this
this my this book ah it really
i'd say this was almost like a paradigm shift when i started reading books on sales because before that i had a very very
quite negative view of sales and making money and
reading these books and just reading authors just say like yeah like you've got to not be afraid of sales you've got to not think that it's a bad thing
you've got to not think that it's immoral or that you know you're doing anyone a disservice you've got to think that you're actually providing value
there's a customer with the need and you're trying to help them fulfill that need and if it's your product then it's a win-win for both of you and there's
like there was another book that's coming up but there was like there's another book i will discuss soon
but it was almost like made my jaw drop of like how in depth it was like okay when the
customer has this kind of objection you should use this kind of solution and this kind of attitude from the customer
you should use this it's kind of like this is a skill that [ __ ] have been leveling up and the fact that they've just put these like learning
lessons in books just blows my mind
Copywriting
okay the next book we have is called kashvatisik by drew eric whitman now that one right
there wait this one cashvertising so this is a book on copywriting so
copywriting is kind of like sales but through text so sales is quite broad and obviously it's just sales can be broken
down into many many different aspects of sales copywriting is when you're trying to sell through like text on like
computer page it's kind of like obvious in a sense but it's like for example when you go onto
my course page or you go on to some random like um website which sells you some [ __ ]
the text there would be called copywriting that's like sales text sales
in person is is somewhat similar it still follows the same principles it's still like you know asking questions and everything but of
course it's a very different dynamic when it's on text and this is actually a very very important skill to learn because
how much how many person-to-person sales is actually going on for most people
when you really think about it like i don't really do sales in a call in a person i wouldn't really
ever do of course like you know this there is the good point that we're always selling and everything but in general if you're thinking about
specifically selling okay products for money i did a couple of like somewhat sales
stuff when i would take calls for my coaching and you know try and like you know use some sales tactics but honestly
it it's not so important to know those like great sales skills because the best
coach the best coaching clients i had you know i would do like free calls or anything or do like a very like
affordable first call and you maybe want to book onto the package the clients that i got they really liked the
first call and they were like yeah let's do it i didn't have to actually sell them stuff the people that i had to use like the
sales tactics on always ended up just being less motivated for the the coach in any way and of course
this is because coaching is like a service you have to commit to so of course like that it's more detrimental for it
but in general you're not really going to use the actual sales skill to sell products
if you're doing a business similar to mine you're not going to be the one who's taking the sales calls if i did make a new premium product that required
you know an actual phone sale i wouldn't be the one doing it i would go employ someone for like 10 20 30 an hour or
something and they would be the one selling like you know they'd answer like the zoom call when someone wanted to buy
my stuff copywriting is how we sell in the modern day so if you're about to do a business
similar to mine if you want to be a youtuber you will eventually end up selling something on like a new page and
the page that you'll use will go into these books but essentially what you'll do is you'll make a landing page like a sales page so it's not like a normal
website because normal websites there's too much [ __ ] clutter you may have seen my aesthetic body course like linked in my main channel
and it's like it's almost like it almost looks like somewhat of like a scam website if you didn't really know what
it was but like a normal website has like you know loads of buttons on the home page the help button and everything
when you're just trying to sell you want literally nothing so you make a landing page a sales page which is literally just almost like a white page which just
text down the middle in a video and everything it's step by step and everything like that we go through and a page a um
a book like this teaches you the basics of copywriting so it's very similar to the skill sales skill but it's a lot
more based on the modern sort of selling on website so for example he'll tell you what type of headline to have the
headline should be five words or less and it should have this font and it should be this big and you should have like underneath the headline you should
have a subheading you know like all this kind of quite like specific stuff that you should know now i read this book and
it was pretty helpful and i definitely like got my first sales from it but there is a book three books that we will go on to
discuss as we get to them on my kindle that kind of just made this book negligible and we'll go on to them soon
so the next one i've got an audible uh one here i'm surprised that that's on because it's not like an actual book
where it's like an audio book for can't hurt me by david goggins so this is like a standard very popular book right now
can't hurt me by david goggins this is like the type of book that is just
it's a very very very high quality quite like popular standard book on building discipline and the value of it comes not
from specific discipline tactics but just from hearing the story of someone who went through a lot and then he's got
giving you his like sort of mental models his mindset his mentalities on how he can push faster
faster harder whatever continue just um going even when it when it hurts now
he i developed my discipline especially the phrase that i use do the hard work
especially when you don't feel like it that's the the explanation of discipline is that phrase
i developed all that before i actually read this book but i feel like i would have gotten to this point of my discipline way faster if i read this
book earlier and in fact um i haven't read this book i've listened to and if i was you like i wouldn't like
i can't really say because i haven't read it but i would assume the book is nowhere near as good as the actual audio book so you can get the audio book on
audible and for me personally like the best thing to do is quite a common sense i'm surprised people haven't done
this but literally put your earphones in listen to the audio book instead of reading it and do it whilst you're doing
some activity that requires discipline so i would listen to it when i would run to the gymnastic ring spot so you know
there's a sense of discipline i'm like literally running with like a heavy backpack and everything some people just prefer to read it but
in my opinion a book like this isn't meant to be just read when you're in like the comfort of your home it kind of destroys the purpose so i would listen
to it when i was like going on runs and i was like cycling to kickboxing and all this
Deep Work
we have a book here deep work by cal newport right there next to my thumb deep work by cal newport now i've
mentioned this book loads of time so i won't explain it too much pretty much the idea is that most of us are doing very shallow work not only the tasks
that we're choosing to spend our time on but also the way that we work the tldr of this is that deep work will be the
best work that you produce and it has such a huge benefit not only to your level of like you know your career or
your business advancement but also to your like philosophical like your spiritual your your emotional
fulfillment because when you produce some awesome work you feel [ __ ] sick but most of us don't produce that
awesome work because we're constantly just dabbling in like shallow work shallow work is [ __ ] that like
just isn't really that important it doesn't require all of your mental cognition so for example shuttle work is like answering emails
it's like me being on discord and i'm moderating discord or doing something for something that i would don't really have to do deep work is like this no one
else can do this for me no one else can record these videos exactly like me no one could be hamster on the camera
that's deep work the idea of this book deep work by cal newport is to essentially just completely stay hyper
focused on the task that you're doing so no [ __ ] distractions no checking your phone in between or anything and to
prioritize and almost only do those deep work those high caliber activities and
the shallow work that you do have outsource it eliminate it it's very very similar to the concept in the four-hour
work week and this book and the four hour work week always get quite hated on to get people
being critical of it because everyone's like oh but you i can't work only four hours but like okay like join me like it works for a
lot of people who work for me and if you want to reject yourself from the principles of this because you need to
work 10 hour days and stuff all right fine fair enough but that's your loss
let's see where are we
Atomic Habits
i've got atomic habits by james clear here as an audible i'm not gonna lie this is a very very very highly rated
book it's like the book that everyone raves about with self-improvement it's like the cornerstone i'm not gonna lie like i i never really liked it i never
really like got much from it and i think the reason why was because i've never really struggled with implementing a new
habit because for me personally it's like when i was going self-improvement when i discovered this book i realized like
not to put this guy down but it's like his strategy of implementing new habits is completely and utterly subpart of
mind which mine was the timetable mine was okay follow the same sort of military style discipline every single day you write
down a timetable i'm going to wake up at 7 am i'm going to do this at 7 30 this at 7 50 whatever and do the same things
almost every single day as best as you can that's better than every other productivity habit tactic that i've ever
come across because this is all about okay implementing a new habit or destroying like a previous habit
my idea with the timetable was that my entire day became a habit it was just way way stronger so personally i didn't
really get too much from atomic habits but if you're not going to live like that lifestyle like i did where you're
doing the same things at the same time every day then yeah a lot of people do rave about this book
The Unplugged Alpha
i have the unplugged alpha by richard cooper it's an audio book so i didn't read this one but it's an audio book
this is like it's kind of like a nice sort of summary of the red pill you don't really
need to know like too much or anything it's just like the unplugged alpha by richard cooper it's just kind of like a
somewhat summary of the red pill is certain dynamics like there's no one that you shouldn't date like single mothers who are older than you or
anything that you should be like um to be honest like there was nothing new
in it so he'd mentioned some good like green flags some red flags there's nothing new if you've read the red pill you don't need to read this book but if
you're like don't really know what the red pill is maybe you'd want to read it it's like it's a very very easy read
and it's by a guy who is fairly successful as well which is quite nice so here we have the first
Dot Com Secrets
book of the trilogy that i just mentioned before there it's called dot com secrets by russell brunson so this
is an absolute this is probably probably the best book that we've come across so far dot com secrets by russell
brunson this is the book that made the copywriting book cash advertising negligible this book is part of a three
series so there's dot-com secrets traffic secrets and expert secrets if you're going to do a social media
business like i am here this is a 10 out of 10 100 recommended
like there's not even a recommendation like you have to read this book to get a good level of success i i promise you
the three books are [ __ ] insane he he has completely just laid out exactly
everything that you need to know to grow a social media sort of business and everything and also to then sell a
premium product alongside it so before it before this i was just kind of making my youtube videos and just kind of doing
what i thought was you know the best case scenario which was i was recording my youtube videos at the end of the video i was saying oh if you want to get
one-to-one coaching by me or if you want to buy my products then you can go to the link in the description and you go to the link in the description and then
there's like a shitty like spot uh shopify page where i'm selling my stuff and i was you know like i made like a
thousand pounds a month one thousand five hundred one thousand seven hundred so it's not you know it's a full-time income it wasn't bad i followed the tips
on this and immediately times that by three four five so i went from 1 500 to 4 300 to 13 200
per month right and there's just so many different things in
this it's [ __ ] insane like this is a guy who has probably spent like a hundred million on my advertising and
split testing and everything but this this stuff blows my mind it might take me a while to explain imagine
the smallest change on a sales page can lead to the sale or not like isn't
that doesn't that blow your mind imagine okay there's a sales page for my course a certain
like word a font a size a um [Music]
an actual font like you know the type of text that you have that can completely change whether or not someone actually buys and so sales online like online
income and like you know digital selling is all just about increasing your conversion rate so your conversion rate
is just what percentage of people who land on your sales page actually check out so a good conversion rate is like five percent something like that right
this is probably the guy who's tested like it out more than everyone else who's like fully come up with literally
the exact format of your sales page he made a software that he essentially promotes through these books called
click funnels i don't use it because i had already like set up using kajabi which is like a different
platform if i was going to start again if for example i lost everything if i was going to make a new business or even if i was going to make a new product i'm
going to use click funnels 100 it's like the best thing that you can use right now but click funnels it's kind of like a separate thing it's kind of like the
software that you use to actually host your website your sales page to sell things and it gives you the best
settings out of every like website online it gives you like the best settings to like split test things but
in dot com secrets traffic secrets and expert secrets he fully fully goes into detail of exactly what you should do to
grow your youtube channel and your your tick tock and your emails and everything the gist is that you start off with like
this is like marketing 101 right so you start off pic thinking about the customer and who you could help who who
could be your avatar so when i read this book for me like i really spent some time on it and it was younger hamster and it was a certain like period of
younger hamza's life which i knew that i could help him the most and i knew that you know he really really like there's lots of people just like him then the
idea is that you start to think okay in which area can you help them the most health wealth or relationships you start
you know dialing down your message he teaches you like literally the formula to use for youtube and everything and of
course my formula in terms of youtube scripts is better than his but like his one is a very very like high quality one
to if you just suddenly read it and start a youtube channel you'd be miles ahead of like 90 of people anyway
traffic secrets is all about increasing your traffic increasing your audience and then expert secrets is like this idea that you've already got the
fundamentals set up expert secrets like makes you more of an expert in your fuel so you really really begin to like give
the best advice incredible three books literally so so high quality three books
that it blows my mind that people who are into like you know social media businesses haven't read
them yet the next book we have here is models by mark manson so mark manson is the guy
who wrote this book there's a lot not given a [ __ ] but he he wrote this one first models by mark
manson attract women through honesty so this is it's a fairly good book and and i listened to i didn't read it but i
listened to it and when i was going through i'm not going to lie i realized like he's just fantastic at marketing essentially the book got famous because
he's he said the most important things to attract a woman is honesty and authenticity and vulnerability those are
three things that you'd you're just you'd imagine like that's not true especially if you're into red bull wait
honesty or authenticity vulnerability no that can't be true essentially he's he's played a very very clever game here
where he's he's disguised the word vulnerability and honesty and authenticity as just
confidence it took me a while to realize but once you kind of like once the veils pull back you realize the book's not really
that special he says oh yeah you should have the vulnerability like the most important thing is to have the vulnerability to go up and like kind of
like express to a woman that you really like her right but that's just confidence and of course if he if the book was all about attract
women through confidence it wouldn't have done anywhere near as well but because it's like attract women through vulnerabilities kind of like an
interesting topic and it's got so many guys talking either way it's a very solid book and it's one of
those where like it's quite a it has a very very very healthy approach to it which the red pill generally
doesn't so when i was i was listening to the book and i used to think like you know what if i read if i listened to this book
years ago things would have been very very different this book along with a couple of like fundamental red pill posts and like you know understanding
would have like been all that i needed to really know you can definitely go like too far into the red pill which is what i mentioned
recently and it can be a beautiful thing it can be like a very like eye-opening thing when you do take the red pill but
the issue is that the red pill is very very diluted by the people online like you know the red
pill like the fundamental is just like the fundamental beliefs that the rational male uh you you learn from the
rational male but um it's a pretty good book models attract
women through honesty
what else do we have the next one i have is attached by dr amir levine attached so this is a book
on attachment styles i've mentioned this book a bunch of times so i won't go too much into it your attachment styles is
kind of like your dating personality and we all have like a certain dating personality that's pretty much formed by
the experiences that we had as children now some people think that this is like too reductionist and they think like wait no like you know just because your
parents treated you in this way doesn't mean that you all turn out this way i completely disagree with those those people and the simple fact is like
90 probably more 90 of people don't do any significant self-improvement to actually change
like the deter whatever they were determined to be like due to their parents like their upbringing so chances
are you included because you'd probably be on our self-improvement for like a year or two compared to you know 15 17
20 22 years of life that you've had just passively going through life chances are
you are extremely extremely influenced by your childhood upbringing right now but you
don't even realize it and of course not only is that just all parts of life but of course it's going to be a date
into and so the things that you observed in your parents and how your parents loved you and how they loved each other
it's gonna really really make up your understanding of dating right now and this isn't to say that you'll end up
exactly like them but generally a lot of people end up very very very similar like scarily similar to their parents
even though they're so consciously sure that they are 100 sure they're not
there's i won't go to too much detail but there's like there's three main attachment styles there's secure
avoidant and anxious i'm naturally the anxious style and essentially the purpose of this book and
the purpose of like your date in life if you are avoiding or anxious it's just just emulate the secure type till
eventually you can like you can embody the secure attachment the secure attachment is kind of like healthy
people who saw like healthy loving relationship between their parents which honestly is like it's actually quite rare most people have experienced quite
an avoidant parent so like you know the dad who's always like working and he never shows love or the anxious where
you got like abused by your parents or your parents abuse each other or they just kind of like were very like your parents mental health was [ __ ] so they
were shouting at all the time so your sense of love is very fragile and because of that you act in a very you
act in like a very scarce way where you want to hold on to every love every bit of affection that you can do and of
course this is going to like really [ __ ] up your day in life and your your sexual life as you get older because there's people who aren't good for you but you
kind of fall for them just because of the fact that there's a shred of affection there which is my life story
let's see what else do we have i have here the male advantage by chris
sturmley sturm sturmy chris and i've got the the paper like
that's my boy so this is chris's book from the youtube channel first man and it's a book the mail
advantage it's essentially a a book based on most of the topics that he talks about
on his channel the book is very small you can literally read it in one sitting it took me like two two and a half hours to read it all it's
if you've watched a bunch of his videos so you might have like watched his videos but if you've been like me like i've went down this channel i've watched
like a lot of his videos probably like 60 to 70 percent he's got hundreds of videos there's nothing like that new in
the book so it's like you can choose which one but for me personally like i like if there's a certain topic like i'm
really interested in i like revolving myself around it so reading the book still made some things click even though
there was nothing exactly new in the book that he hasn't mentioned on his youtube channel but he's wet like it's
in very good detail in a bunch of these so i lent this book to my friend and he's the one who's like added all this
stuff but there was a certain bit that i messaged chris about as well um
where was it now it's really good i'm not gonna lie like
when i'm flicking through it right now it's like there's a bunch of just nice
learning lessons that you can constantly just come back to so if i open a random page
like here he talks about the darwinian male concept so he's mentioned this on his
youtube videos all the time but he's kind of going into detail by saying like you know what what was once expected
what was once praised is now expected
and things have gotten harder for men especially in the dating market so we have to be doing more things it's
a very very good book it's very it's a very like digestible book the ebook as well i read when i was in
portugal
the next one i have is psycho cybernetics by maxwell maltz this one is the audio book i've got the
actual book as well i mentioned this book recently a couple of times and i made a video about it so i won't mention
it too much the book is all about self-image and the fact that whatever we play in our mind
heavily influences our self-image the
i won't go too much because i've explained it a lot but the general just in terms of just practicality of what exactly you should do is just constantly
make sure you're improving your self-image in your mind the way you see yourself is incredibly important and he
goes through a bunch of things but the two things i like the most is visualizations and success memories visualizations visualize a
realistic reasonably unreasonable end goal of the thing that you want so for
example if there's a cute girl there every guy will who you know wants to go speak to her the majority guys will say
like oh i don't want to speak to her because they're just [ __ ] virgins and they don't know like they can go speak to a girl but like of the guys who would
go and approach her before they go to speak to her they're thinking about what to say the issue is that whatever you think of your mind your body and your
personality conveys and so you go up to her as the guy who's kind of you know
a bit hesitant you go up to as the guy who's over thinking about what to say to her which which isn't like that attractive whereas if you just instead
of thinking what to say but if you just focus on the mental picture of her the end point that you want so the end point
in this like reasonably unrealistic scenario is maybe you guys going on a spontaneous date or at the very least
you know she's like handing you your phone with her number with like a sexy smile on her face you just focus on that
because now when you go up to it even though you haven't prepared a [ __ ] script not only like not preparing the script is gonna make you better because
you're not talking like a robot but two you're gonna go up as the personality of the guy who's already gotten her number
so it's a very very like different atmosphere like different personality as you go up and successful mind is just
nice and simple just constantly just remind yourself of the successes that you've had because you'll you'll just keep yourself in like feeling like a
winner and you're you just get so much easier into a flow this is the kind of [ __ ] that like
that ryan holliday would probably disagree with you know the stoics amongst us and the philosophers would disagree with and they'd say no there's
value in being negative and there's value in like not feeling like a success and they're absolutely right in terms of
growth but day to day i'm not going to lie forget all that day to day bro i i want to feel good day to day i want to like
fuel like i want to remind myself of the good things that i've done so that i feel good and i'll get more into a
social flow but if for example i remind myself well yeah like you approached like 10 girls last week then i'm more likely to go and approach this 11th one
instead of thinking like oh wait let me be humble he goes there anyway like [ __ ] all that bro
sorry brian holiday the next one i have over there is a audio book hard times create strong men by stefan
arnio this so it's an audio book this is a long-ass audio book i listened to it
over months it's 26 hours long i believe the book's like hundreds and hundreds of pages this is a fantastic book and it's
it's literally it covers so many different areas of life it literally just it kind of
answers the question of like what does it mean to be a man what is masculinity how do you become like a man man what's
wrong with today's society it gives you lessons from history lessons from like philosophy and
it predicts some very scary things so in the next video of the hamza filter channel i'm going to be speaking about
this book it's going to be a to kind of like distill it down into my mind and actually
you know i really think about it but it's quite some scary [ __ ] because there's a certain pattern that happens
in nations in history which is that good times create weak men and that's
the time that we're in right now when you can see the weak men are being created but this time is almost over
weak men create hard times i think that's gonna start any like we're going through some hard times eventually like
soon and i think maybe within maybe this year maybe within two three
years we'll officially feel like we're in the hard times where resources will be scarce there'll be like a lot more
turmoil in like in a in a cities and everything um week so what is it it's
good times great weak men weak men create hard times hard times creates strong men strong men create good times
this book honestly it kind of like re it gave me like a paradigm shift
because i realized like perhaps one of the most important things that we could be doing right now as young men is to become strong
because good men create hard times create strong men which is probably going to be soon and so right now we're
in the good times like every need that you have is like ticked off in a sense but we are branching to the hard times right you can have this call to action
right now and you can become one of these strong men because strong men create good times and you're gonna have a good [ __ ] time if you're one of those strong men if you're like the
warrior in times of uncertainty if you're the scientist in times of
pandemics and [ __ ] you're gonna be the one who reaps the [ __ ] rewards of that it's time to be like ready for this
[ __ ] like this book fully just it makes you really look at like like
our lives in these like you know privileged countries and everything with a second lens and of course there's
probably someone watching this who doesn't live in a first world country but at least for me like i've only ever lived in like the uk really like i was
born in pakistan where we moved here when i was quite young so i don't i only know like a first
world western white nation which is very very safe and like friendly and of course
like we went through racism and [ __ ] like it's it's very very safe there's no wars or any [ __ ] like that
and i think things are going to change quite dramatically i think we are headed into like the hard times and so why not
just get like a run-up why not just start running right now getting used to becoming a strong man before you
actually need to be the next book here is traffic secrets so
we just mentioned that with dot com seekers that's the trilogy i have here the rational mail this is the religion
one i've not read this one but there's we'll go through the rational mail in general so the rational bill is the
in fact the rational mail actually read it when i first came back here so may 2020 i read it about that time and i
actually got the book so i was like red pills for years but i never bothered to even read the the rational mail i just
kind of thought the red pill was the subreddit and the book is hard to read i'm not
going to lie the author roller tomassi has like a very very like he writes like a bit of a dick i'm not
gonna lie like not even like offensively or anything he's just like he uses like just [ __ ] huge words and like quite
hard to understand grammar he's maybe he's probably like a very intelligent guy or something but it's like a very hard to read book and it's one of those
where like even though i've recommended it to bear people and they've like tried to read it pretty much everyone puts the book back down because it is like it's
just incredibly hard to read his writing style and you can kind of get like a distilled distillation
of his book on you know the subreddit and everything but if you commit to reading the rational mail the the first
book and i've read the second one and the third one the the value you get is immense again it's
one of those concepts where you might already understand the topic but when you revolve your life around it when
you're reading a book for a couple of hours a day like you s you take it seriously so i was reading this book
when i first moved back and it was just hitting me of like how truthful this was it was kind of like i just got bread
pilled again like properly so all the previous times where i thought i was red pill from age 17 or 18. it was more in
like a pickup artist sense where i just kind of learned how to get girls and i learned some basic [ __ ] like you know like um
alpha [ __ ] beta bucks one and itis and everything but it was from these books i actually started to like learn like deal
this [ __ ] goes deep this isn't just about picking up women this is like literally discussing of how societies
ran and the history of like male and female dynamics this shit's important
the next one i have here is tim ferriss's book the four-hour work week so tim ferriss was the one who made
this one and no sorry this is the four-hour work week this book is the four-hour body i'm not gonna lie i don't
really like this one i really really like tim ferriss's work and i feel like i might be one of those haters who like hates on this book and sounds like it's
unrealistic but for this one the four hour body i i haven't really like it's a bunch of
like somewhat fast paced advice and the idea is like the thing is
the uncommon guide to rapid fat loss incredible sex and becoming superhuman so it sounds very clickbaity and in the
back it says like oh like 15 minute orgasms and all this and it's it doesn't for me personally it didn't
like deliver the value that it stayed like a lot when you get to the advice it's one of those where you're like like
nah that's just it's either not gonna work or it's just one of those things like you're not gonna be able to do it so one of the random things is like for
example he said the best way to like make gains is literally to do like seven
reps of of two exercises and then go home and then not try in for like three days this like that that's like like new
age [ __ ] where it's like oh he made this workout routine that like got him 30 pounds of muscle in a month okay sure
bro come on john mean it's one of those where it's like if you're actually into fitness and [ __ ] you know that's just complete
[ __ ] [ __ ] there's other things which is like a lot of it's been disproven by like
research but there's other things which he says like where he's doubled his testosterone by eating like almonds and
brazil nuts and whilst that does give you some of a boost it's like
this is why to be honest i don't [ __ ] with like research i don't [ __ ] you know people always ask me like oh cite the
research that's why i don't [ __ ] because this guy i know for a fact that he's done this in like a research where he
he's like a fully the most popular human guinea pig in the world right now he's like you know he's like the the
multi-millionaire guy who's who went through thousands of tests for all this got his bloods taken is like all this
you know like the scientific [ __ ] right but it's just so simple to so not i'm not saying he manipulated
the the research but it's so simple to just have research that proves you right or proves you wrong so for example for
the brazil to the testosterone like the main thing he did was like the brazil nuts and the almonds and you know some random [ __ ] right and the thing is
if we take a normal healthy person give them some brazil nuts and almonds the testosterone is probably not going to go
up significantly maybe like very very insignificantly right but of course his research proves that it went up by
double now this makes you think okay but like maybe he was just like dangerously low fat
speed when he originally took his test and that's like there we go this is why i don't [ __ ] with like scientific research because it's like it's so easy
to just get research that proves you right proves you wrong that he might have just been eating a
very very low amount of dietary fats and then he ate it so now he's at a healthy level so it's not so much that you know
brazil nuts double your testosterone it's just more that his testosterone went down because for a little while
consciously or subconsciously he just was like a very low dietary fat macronutrients
i didn't personally like this book to be honest
what else we have i've read 20 of this book called the 5 a.m club by robin sharma
this book's like really really famous this guy is really famous robin sharma he's like a big guy for like ceos and
rich people trash book one of the worst ones i actually read 29 like i got pissed off at it i'm not gonna lie i
heard so many good things about this book it's this you know proper motivation the five eight you know wake up at 5 a.m and like you follow this
morning routine and everything and the way that it's written is just [ __ ] horrendous i just got pissed off at it
like instead of just telling you like you know like 5am and everything like he walks you through like this [ __ ] fake
conversation but and it's like just [ __ ] right in as well the homeless man moved at the speed of an ancient turtle and
then he turned his head like shut the [ __ ] up bro [ __ ] you
this was and i i like this one the 10x rule by grant cardone
so grant cardone gets like quite a lot of flack as like a lot of like business
gurus and you know success gurus do they they get flacked by broke people i'm not
gonna lie like it seems to me like the people who hate like these people and they'll be oh my god they sell expensive courses they they do expensive most of
it shut the [ __ ] up bro that's he literally is worth almost 100 million so just shut the [ __ ] up like join me
like i dislike the people who dislike that idea of like
oh online gurus like shut the [ __ ] up like i don't know maybe because i'm like
potentially i don't know i wouldn't really class myself as a guru but i feel like i could be like classified as one by like someone who doesn't like me and
they're like oh look here's another self-improvement guru who's charging for courses and stuff but at least this book helped me
he gets a lot of flack and so i was quite hesitant to read this book but i also kind of knew that the people who kind of criticized people like this like
ultra wealthy people who given like motivational like you know like this tony robbins and all this
i've always known the people who criticized them are just [ __ ] because it's just that thing of like oh there's a guy who's worth 100 million like he
must be scamming people just set up a goal the 10x rule is it's kind of like a basic success
book so it's just really nice to hear like the learning lessons from someone who's very successful very wealthy he's got multiple companies who've also got a
loving family home and everything and you just kind of get like a bunch of his wisdom there's not so much that i can be like you know i can particularly say to
you but what the the general idea he says is pick your goal which is like very very
reasonable times it by 10 and then also times by 10 the amount of effort that you're willing to put in and that's the
best case scenario so he says like people just sell themselves too short they they choose goals that are too weak and then of course they're not motivated
to do that he says pick a goal make the goal 10 times bigger so that's hugely motivational but then also make your
output or your input sorry 10 times bigger as well which it's like a nice idea i disagreed with the idea of like
oh yeah like you know um 10 times your effort because i don't believe the extra effort equals output i don't believe that 10
times effort equals 10 times out for i think it's like 10 times effort equals 1.5 times output in my opinion if you um
if if you've got the right type of business like i've been doing we have here how to do the work by dr
nicole lipera i've mentioned that book a lot it's a very um
it's a it's a good introduction to trauma and like childhood wounds and there's just a bunch of like advice in
it in like stories on [ __ ] like abuse you may have experienced
as a child and then how to um heal from that so some of the random
ones that i can remember right now is re-parenting so that's like the box literally all about like the
work that you can do to heal from your trauma so like one of the things she says is re-parenting we start to kind of
feel like you're now re-parenting your inner child so we all have like an inner child inside of us that still like hurts
from the wounds that he may have went through from childhood if you've got like abused by your parents and the idea is that you you parents that inner child
the way that it should have you know you you gave it the love the unconditional love and like the attention that it
needs it explains a bunch of concepts like dissociation flashbacks and everything so it's a very
good introduction into trauma so i think yeah it's the first book that i read about trauma and i'm glad that i really
did that we've got the charisma myth by olive
olivia fox cabin cabin the the charisma myth very
very good standard kind of social skills book a bit more advanced this book actually
goes into things like presence and mindfulness which is very nice because that's incredibly important in social skills the idea is christmas is like the
skill that you really like the best skill in social skills it's like being it's like this magnetic personality where you're
confident but you're also warm but you're also powerful so imagine that it's like it's someone in a powerful
position who you look up to but who's who's like warm and loving to you that's like charisma but he's also like to
everyone right everyone seems to love him he seems to love everyone that's a charismatic person he walks in and everyone's talking to him right you want
to be like that type of guy and this book breaks down the ways to like become more charismatic but also in detail of
like the different types of charisma and everything it's quite an advanced look at this skill of charisma the things i
can remember from it is that there's three pillars of not three
pillars but there's like three things that influence your level of charisma and that is presence
power yeah presence power and warmth presence is like mindfulness because you can't be
charismatic if you're constantly distracted you can't be charismatic for example we're having a conversation and i like date and start daydreaming that's
very anti-charismatic power you need to have like a level of like power and status in the situation
to be seen as charismatic because if you don't have that if you've got presence and warmth you just got you're kind of
like a nice person but you're not like important so we don't really value your presence and warmth unless if you've got
power and so this is the interesting one most people who have power don't have either of these maybe they have power
maybe that maybe they have power and presence but they usually don't have warmth and so that's like you know the
kind of like the cold leader and we still like the cold leader but the guy who also has warmth alongside
that is that's like the best case scenario the warmth is kind of like they treat you nicely
so you can so you can like implement this into your life you can start meditating and do exercises that bring
you back to the present moments when you're in a conversation you know take a seriously think about the sensation of
being sad look into the person's eyes power is the things you kind of do outside of the situation so you want to
bring up your social status in the environment that you're in as well as just sort of convey that social status
by things like your body language your dress sense and warmth is just kind of like being nice to people
very very good if you can improve all three you really really stop getting like liked by people
we have the body keeps the score by where is it the body keeps the score by
bessel van der kolk so i listened to it on audiobook and i bought this book as
well this is a very very in-depth view at trauma trauma and ptsd so this book
i'm not gonna lie it's it is a pretty good book but one of the things i didn't realize is that this book is way way
more about just normal ptsd which is like a one-time event so if you've been
assaulted if you've been in a car crash or something like that if you've been in like a traumatic event that has stopped and it was one time
then this book like the book's really good anyway and it's really really interesting gives you like very very interesting stories about like people in
vietnam and everything but it pretty much entirely focuses on just
ptsd which for me personally isn't exactly what i have so if you've been like abused by your parents you oh you
had like repetitive assault and everything you will most likely have complex ptsd
where essentially imagine it's ptsd but you're getting that traumatic event every few days when you're getting like beats by your parents or you're getting
like screamed out or something so this book i'm not gonna lie it was kind of like um what's that word anti-climatic for me
where i was getting to the end and i realized like a lot of the things he suggested was like yes it's pretty good and everything but it wasn't really
aimed towards me i still really enjoyed the book i really captivated my attention and i still talk quite a few
learning lessons from it and it gave me the advice of um starting yoga which i've done and it has actually got some
very good advice because the things that really helped me in my my own sort of trauma healing is what he's mentioned so
he's mentioned martial arts weightlifting meditating journaling as well
we have the way of the superior man by david dida data
oh right there this is a very very good book it's very interesting and it's very um
it's a very it's it's kind of hard to read in a sense but not with like words but it's one of those where it's like you're
supposed to you read like a chapter or a paragraph and you sit there and you contemplate it and it's this idea of
like becoming like a superior man and it's a very interesting thing so one of the first key points he says is like
breathe probably breathe into your stomach expand your stomach take up some room and you breathe and everything but
it goes on to like even explain semen retention before it was even popular online and it says like you should be
you should like a weak man ejaculates essentially even when he's having sex he's like he gives you teachings on how
to stay on human retention especially when you're having sex and say actually when you follow that advice i'm looking
at is [ __ ] incredible so i i don't think i need to say anything more about this book the way of the superior mind it's also got a bunch
of if there's chapters on like on loving women there's chapters on like philosophy on making money on work and
the soul and everything so it's literally just like how do you become like an advanced man not so much like you know
the one percent type of man that like me and chris from first man talk about when we talk about money and stuff this is more about like that level of like
masculine enlightenment
we're almost at the end now so this book was supposed to be near the start but it's the magic of thinking big by david
schwartz right there in the middle so this is a very good book it was the book i read after how to win friends and
influence people it was one of the first books i got my kindle and it was recommended in the end of this book by
the four hour work week so tim ferriss mentions this the magic of thinking big at the end and it's just it really is
the title of the book is just kind of think bigger stop setting these small goals stop living this small life and
start like thinking bigger start like setting some big ass [ __ ] goals because i like i am so grateful that i
read this [ __ ] you know still to this day people talk to me about like my goals and they kind of like like my friends and they kind of like say it in
like a funny way like oh but you've read the magic of thinking big so i bet you've already like you're already planning to hit like a million subscribers or something i'm telling you
right now we are where we are on the channel because of this book and because of this idea i am
where i am in my physique because of this concept of course i only read this book like a year and a half ago
and you know i started my physique years ago but i've always been like a fairly big thinker
one of the things recently like i forgot what it was but it's like as soon as i start something new like for example kickboxing i think big straight away and
i'm thinking like yeah like i could probably go into the ufc or something like that like you should you should have that mindset that's reasonably
unreasonable now of course i'm not saying i'm going to go to the ufc and win right now but the idea is yeah like if i wanted to i could do of course i'd
train almost every day and i'd trade like years first but you've got to think that it's possible
i know my camera's gonna die again okay that is the second battery that we've run through for this video so the
next book here is complex ptsd from surviving to thriving by pete walker
next to my thumb right there so this is a book that i've recently been speaking about on my channel like over the last
month or so and this is like the book that i actually wrote [ __ ] this is a book that i really needed to read
because it's all about complex ptsd and this like that's the [ __ ] that i have so
if you're somewhat like me and you got beat by your parents and you got like [ __ ] abused for years through your
childhood then this is the type of like knowledge that you need i found that a lot of books on like mental health don't
actually talk about childhood abuse at all when in fact i think that
child abuse is probably the most common yeah i think child abuse is the biggest reason for adult mental health problems
but it's just one of those like undiscussed things that like you know people are so certain that they're not like holding trauma from their childhood
when they actually are i can't give too much advice because i'm not done reading it just yet i'm about halfway through but
there's a bunch of like very like small snippets of advice so one of the random ones that i've mentioned previously on a
video on this hamster film still hamster unfiltered channel is the value of like angering or venting
of like you know reclaiming your aggression that was stomped out of you that was like beaten out of you as a child so if you've had a similar dynamic
to me where like you got hurt you know you got beat by your parents or something by something but then if you
got angry about that if you kind of voiced your you know aggression your resentment for you got beat again
it's kind of like your ability to be angry has been so stomped out that you would actually get value in being
angry at how you were raised it's very interesting topics and i'm not gonna lie like i started reading it a while ago
and then moved on to some other books i feel like i've got to reread it and really kind of grasp it because it it's
quite a huge huge topic to be thinking about every single time i read it was just quite
mentally draining and i feel like i grew a fair amount but i also feel like i somewhat resented like
trying to process a lot of this stuff at once because i was doing therapy and everything at the time as well
so this is a book that i've just recently started reading i recently read sorry and i pretty much read usually i read 10
different books at once so i've got 10 different books open or whatever i feel curious for i'll read this book i opened
it and literally like read it start to finish it was one of those books for me and the book title is essentialism by
greg mcewen essentialism fantastic book this is the type this book like is what
i needed at the time this was literally just two weeks ago so and the basic idea we do way too much in
this modern day we're so focused on so many different things and that that diversifies us which feels like a
good thing but it also just spreads you out too thin so it's like this certain image where like you can go one
centimeter like one little bit in like 10 different directions and essentially you're a complete noob or you know
you're not anything special in any of these or you can go one big line in one
direction one topic so the idea is instead of trying to do 10 different things some [ __ ] online like i literally see them boast about the fact
that they've got like seven companies or some [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up bro how about you make one company successful don't ask that's like the reason why i
was able to build this body is because i did nothing else first i started 2014 i believe and the only productive thing i
was doing was just building this body alongside like you know trying to learn how to speak to girls and stuff that was it
if i tried to do all of this at once if i tried to build this body the mental health the business and everything i
wouldn't have done any of them i would have been so subpar in all of them too many guys are doing way too much and
in terms of tasks as well this has really changed up a lot for me recently i realized like he drills in this thing
of view and the author says like you have a highest point of contribution
in a certain task do that and do nothing else for me it's obvious right it's the
videos but i was doing a fair like i was spending more than like half an hour to an hour on discord on my discord server
but i [ __ ] moderate i've got like so many moderators who are like happy to do the role and i was moderating it myself and i was like going through every
single chat and every making sure that no one's chatting [ __ ] about me and [ __ ] and um the same with like the podcast that i've
like every podcast that i've done in a while apart from like the one with chris cause if that felt like i was speaking
to a friend and we were just [ __ ] around but everyone that i've had people come onto my podcast i've resented it
like i couldn't be bothered because i just realized like that's not what's important right now eventually i will get into podcasting like kind of like
full time and it'd be awesome to do that but right now it's not something i'm interested in so i cut it out to all you [ __ ] who've been telling me
how's it get on sister shut the [ __ ] up get on tick tock it's not essential podcast [ __ ] live streams it's not
essential so i'll do it when it's fun but i'm not gonna set that thing of like oh you know
everyone is going to tell you there's some other thing that you can do it's a skill and it's a discipline to be
an essentialist to listen to that [ __ ] like to listen to you know someone tell you oh there's this good opportunity and for you to
think nope it's not it's not essential there's a fantastic quote from this that i wrote on my wall and you know if i've
wrote something on my wall and i've stuck it on my [ __ ] wall you know that it's like there's some value in that
so let's see that every almost everything is noise
i love that almost everything is noise when i've read that quote and he's telling me like yeah most of the things
that you're doing is just noise and you're just kind of like it's a distraction from the things that matter
i was like holy [ __ ] i'm actually like he's totally right i'm reading every comment on youtube i'm like i'm just
spending so much [ __ ] time just doing stuff that doesn't matter all that matters for me is the videos that's it
that's all that's all that matters the videos on the main channel videos on this channel that's it nothing else matters as long as these videos keep you
know the videos are good you guys like them and they keep performing well everything else is like sorted
i can spend way more time on the [ __ ] discord server or doing live streams or podcasts but the thing is if the videos
slip so do those things so why not just put your time directly into them and this essentialism along
with deep work and the four hour work week it drastically reduces how much time you need to do your work tasks so
people have asked me like what do you do in your free time whatever i want
well i spend hours in the gym i take long rest breaks i just sit in the sauna i just go in the pool i spend like a
solid three and a half hours like in the gym area like the gym sauna and pool and getting
changed and everything i sit around i read like two hours a day i meditate a journal i do a lot of
thinking instead i do a lot of resting i dedicate like 10 to 11 hours of sleep i'm honestly i'm [ __ ] destroying any
i don't think that there's much competition right now because ever my competition are sleeping like six hours
a day because they're working so much they think that they're winning right now because they're working they don't realize that the real work of like the
knowledge worker the person who uses his brain for like to produce which is what we're doing here like for most of us
the real like thing that makes you good at what you do is sleeping for more than eight hours a
night it's eating clean it's spending time with your friends so often times i do tell people yeah
like i work like a couple of hours a week three to five hours something like that out per week
and they they they don't really believe me or they they think i'm taking the pistol they're like oh no that that would be depressing because like i
wanted to work more than that i'd be bored but it's like it's it's my choice now this video is going to be one and a half
hours long so of course like this week my work hours are going to be longer but it's like it's my choice to be here i'm not being forced to i'm not i'm not
obligated to make this video that's such a beautiful way to live life and because i've cut down because i've
become an essentialist and i'm not doing some random [ __ ] other tasks like checking your [ __ ] emails look at my
youtube uh profile picture on my main channel look at the the channel art still my sister comes to me and says oh
you know it's too old you've got to change it here's some ideas no it's not essential the fact that those like i've built this
success we've got 200k uh subscribers and it's going up fast with that shitty profile picture shows you like it
doesn't make a difference anyone who's spending a [ __ ] hour some people spend longer than that but an hour
making their [ __ ] youtube logo or some [ __ ] they're not gonna be successful because they're focused on the stupidest most
useless part of the business instead of the highest contribute the highest point of contribution which is the actual
video that's where i put my time so even though i only work for a few hours a week because i've become so essential it's like the rest of my life
the rest of the 128 hours or whatever however many hours there are in the day in the week
revolve around those videos so instead of me being sat like a [ __ ] caveman spending hours extra just doing low
quality work i go out into real life i go and do things with friends and go on dates with girls and that's the thing
that actually gives me way more like that's the thing that makes better videos for me
it's a very interesting topic which i think a lot of people still disagree with but at least for me this concept of essentialism of the four
hour work week of highly reducing your work tasks so you can live more and you can fuel those small work hours has been
incredible incredibly life-changing greg mcewen has a second book that i've got here called
effortless that one the
focus [ __ ] yeah effortless uh this book is not as good as the first one it kind of has
like a very similar concept but this one is more about the fact that it should just be like quite easy to you work so
literally this was this was unfortunately one of those books effortless so effortless is like the second book next to essentialism by the
same author greg mcewen this was one of those books that unfortunately was that it was a letdown and it was kind of like
one of those it was just like a one sentence summary which is like yeah like your work should be effortless it should
feel like play that's it you don't need to really know much much else i think maybe there would have been more learning lessons but at least for me
personally a lot of the book was just kind of [ __ ] that i either knew or i just read from his previous book
here we have breath the new science of a lost art by james nester next to my thumb
so that's the book that i mentioned aligned with the oxygen advantage i i personally prefer breath so breath out a
way better sort of storytelling and it's the story of this scientist who voluntarily signed up to do the study of
himself where he blocked his nose and he just mouth breathed for like two weeks his health deteriorated
incredibly fast so it's very it's a very very interesting story that like it's wrote in a very funny way and everything so
you'll probably enjoy reading it and um he just goes into like
so much like detail of the the [ __ ] that happens if you breathe from your nose from your mouth instead of your nose and
there's so many good quotes from literally like you know like chinese provinces like 2 000 years old and
everything where they're mentioning like the dangers of breathing from your mouth and like you should only ever breathe through your nose it's so interesting
like this was this was literally how humans have
lived for so long and only in the last 100 years we've really [ __ ] it up and i really like the fact that he brought in
so much history with it the tldr of this book is what i mentioned before the perfect breath
he says it's five seconds in 5.5 seconds in 5.5 seconds out nice and slow through the diaphragm
and obviously through the nose as well
we have infinite game um the infinite game by [ __ ]
the infinite game by simon sinek next to my thumbnail
this is i only read like 50 probably less i i literally just needed to skim
it just to get it's one of those books where you just needed to get like the idea and like once you've got the idea like the rest of the books not that
great in my opinion but the idea was play the infinite game in the in the stuff that you do instead of the finite
game so find that game to be honest once you kind of understand it kind of like i was like oh yeah well
that's common sense but at least the idea is okay let's say in my example the finite game
is me thinking oh yeah like you know the the the thing that we're trying to do the only thing we care about is hitting
500k subs or one million subs that's like finite and essentially once you hit that you're just gonna be going more and
more the infinite game is kind of like thinking of purpose instead and thinking of like the meaning of all this so it's not so much you know the 500k subs it's
just helping as many like young men as we can the issue why i got disinterested in this is
because the way to do this best to achieve that purpose like he said is to set milestone goals
like the 500k subs so you know that you're going in the right direction so it's like it's it's kind of like oh like
well i got some dude you know you're doing everything right then anyway it's like just have purpose behind what you're doing and also view it as like an
infinite thing so this idea that if for example youtube deletes my channel it that this would still be my purpose i
would just i would continuously fulfill this purpose of helping young guys with self-improvements with date in with
fitness with mental health but i'd do it on a different avenue and i'd be a pedophile on hop on tick-tock or something
so it's kind of like a disappointing once i got that realization i was like oh this book's kind of dead then because the whole point
they were telling you was like okay forget those finite goals forget you know the goals of 500k and everything then eventually oh yeah the best way to
measure if you're achieving the purpose is with those finite goals anyway so it was a bit dead but at least
it did kind of like click something for me where i was like oh yeah like just bear in mind that this is
infinite even if youtube deletes my channel i'm still going to be doing the same work so just make sure you're always holding this purpose with the
intent to like help people we have ego is the enemy by ryan
holliday so this is a staple i've read i haven't read completely but i've got all three books ego's the enemy stillness is
the key and
which is the other one the obstacle is the way i'm not gonna lie
i don't really like them that much because for me personally it's kind of like i just need to read the title and then
i'm like yeah like i can adopt what he's about to say he just it's one of those where like he gives you a bunch of examples and like he breaks it down into
like different criteria so for ego it's broken down into like the actions that you can do the choices that you can make and everything and you know it's really
nice having stories because this i guess is similar to the how to win friends uh argument that i made anyway but it's
kind of like once you read the title you kind of know oh yeah like ego's enemy you kind of just need to understand what the ego is and think
okay let me just make sure that i stay humble and i keep humility and so it hasn't been incredibly like the book
hasn't been that great in terms of i've read like 42 of it but just kind of keeping in mind to keep my ego in check
has been probably like very very helpful there i think that's pretty much it i'm literally on like the books that i'm
currently reading so i'll show you these the book that i literally just finished today is the almanac of
naval ravikant by eric jorgensen and tim ferriss wrote the forward of
that but this is a book distilling this guy's advice so his name is naval ravi
khans he's like a very famous very very successful very wealthy but also very happy guy it's quite a
mix to have usually you'll see someone who's really happy but not so much money or you'll see the one someone who's really really wealthy but not so happy
this guy's the mix of both and so essentially this is like his wisdom on how to build wealth and how to build
happiness i'll be completely honest the happiness section was very very anti-climatic for me kind of fell off but the wealth section especially the
the tweets that he goes through the first like 20 pages of this book was like life change i was
literally sat there like getting goosebumps and everything trying to like you know figure this [ __ ] out after that i feel like i just kind of like skimmed
it so it wasn't so important and it i felt like at least for me personally it felt like a bunch of the book was kind of like all over the place but there was
a bunch of good learning lessons in the first like 20 to 30 pages which i really appreciated
the book that i'm reading right now so there's multiple books one of them is the emperor the appearance of power by
tanner guzwy the appearance of power and it's i'm
literally just a few pages in but it's about the concept of how to look more powerful through your appearance and
what you wear so i'm literally just a few pages in so i can't give you too much advice but it has been recommended to me a couple of times and i think it
is very important there's a quote which i'm just going to say in my words because i can't remember
exactly but it was that to improve your social status and also how you feel about yourself the fastest and cheapest
way is to improve your fashion your wardrobe which i really like that's 100 true we we talk so much about the
importance of like looks maxing in self-improvement it's 100 like you know your appearance is so [ __ ] important in these days then why not just
improve your appearance for a hundred dollars with like a new outfit which actually like really looks good it looks
powerful and everything and like i completely agree with that i'm reading another book called the way
of men by jack donnis donovan this is a book which explains the question of what
is masculinity so i'm 10 into the book right now and it's based on uh
is kind of defined as we are in gangs so we are in like
we're supposed to be in like gangs and tribes and so masculinity is defined in that sense but now that we we aren't
really in tribes anymore masculinity is very like diverse it's open to assumption it's kind of like [ __ ] up
in a sense and it's interesting so far i'm liking like the the rawness of the book and write
like in the fact that you know it's a book about masculinity it's a book about like brotherhood and everything and you those books are somewhat like rare for
them to actually be like good books usually like the authors for those books are kind of weird but i like this guy
we have there's a couple more books as well um i'm not gonna mention a couple of these
because i'm not really liking a couple of them but the final one is courage is calling by ryan holliday
and it's kind of similar to the previous books of his ego's enemy and everything which um
this is like his first book of a new series which he's doing on virtues courage is
defined as the ability to do something that still scares you which i really like it's like knowing that
even if you feel a sense of fear you can still go and do that thing which i think
at least for me personally like the biggest thing that comes to mind with that is like approaching women and like getting over that fear of like approach
anxiety and i feel like it's helping with that as well i would say that's pretty much most of
the books this is a long ass video i'm gonna have to edit this video as well because the battery died like four times but
i'm sure there's other books that someone will say wait you've read that other book as well like what do you think about that but
these are the ones that i have here yeah
mashallah i do have marcus aurelius meditations here but i'm not gonna lie like i've
never really got into it it's not really my thing to be honest i i prefer
the directness of like self-improvement books like just kind of like tell you the lesson or at least like if someone
was gonna distill marcus aurelius i'm pretty sure ryan holiday is a book like that but like for me personally i didn't
like meditations so i've just got that book lying around yeah that is pretty much every book it's as
much as i can remember as much as i've got right now that's every book that's helped me so i hope this video is somewhat valuable and i hope that
someone in the comments has done like a timestamp of the books otherwise she's gonna be sat here going through them all
oh that's so [ __ ] long me i've been recording this video for like more than two hours
do the hard work especially when you don't feel like it
